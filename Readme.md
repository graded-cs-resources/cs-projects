To add a new collection of projects:

1) If this is a new year, create a folder (in the root) for the year.
2) In that folder, create a *.md file for the collection. See bunnygames.md in the 2021 folder for an example
3) Add a spash image for the entire collection in the same folder.
4) Create a subfolder with the same name to hold splash images for each project
5) Open _config.yml and scroll to the collections. 
6) Using the 2021BunnyGames as a template, create a new collection. Start with the year.
7) Make a folder in the root with the name _CollectionName

9) Start the jekyll server and it should all be working! If not,
